A.1.4	*-wū > *-u	/u/ should be unstressed, and /w/ should be after a consonant. This follows directly from rule A.1.3, and therefore the real change is w > ∅ / C _ u.	basic: w > ∅ / [-syllabic] _ u 
A.1.5	*a > *u / _ *m	/a/ should be unstressed.	basic: a{-} > u / _ m
A.1.6	*a > *i / [-stress] _ n	"""It is not entirely clear if this is even a regular sound change""."""	IRG
A.1.7	*ai > *ē	/ai/ should be unstressed.	basic: ai{-} > eː
A.1.8	*u > *[o] / ]σ [-high]	/u/ should be stressed. It can't trigger when there is a nasal or /j/ in the coda. Writing this in one single rule is not achievable since the main rule is a VS-type rule, but the exceptions for nasal consonants and /j/ should use a basic-type. Use the reversion strategy.	VS: u{+} > o / _ [+syllabic, -high]; basic: o{+} > u / _ [+nasal, -syllabic]; basic: o{+} > u / _ j
A.1.9	*ō > ū / _ [σ	/oː/ should be unstressed.	VS: oː{-} > uː / _ @
A.1.10	*V₁V₂ > *V̄₃	"""Unstressed diphthongs were monophthongized to long mid vowels"".

B.1.9	h > Cα / _ #Cα; h > ∅	The first is an assimilation rule across word boundaries, which is treated as out-of-scope. The second change happens "before a word-internal consonant" (h > ∅ / C @), "before consonant clusters" (h > ∅ / _ C C), and "word-finally after stressed syllables" (unrepresentable since stress requires VS-type but /h/ is not a vowel).	basic: h > ∅ / _ [-syllabic] @; basic: h > ∅ / _ [-syllabic] [-syllabic]

B.1.13	*-(i)ji- > *-ī	For /-j-i-/, we can use CL-type rule. For /-i-j-i/, we can syncopate /j/ and then use another CL-type rule to get a long /iː/. This is safe to do since there is no inherited /-i-i/.	basic: j > ∅ / @ i _ i @; CLR: i > iː / _ i; CLR: j > iː / @ _ i @

B.1.22	*þ > t / _ s	This applies to second person dual endings.	basic: θ > t / _ s #
C.1.1	*u > *u, *o	The exact trigger condition of this change seems to be complicated, and the description suggests that it might not be purely phonological since "almost all a-stems feature lowering, but no root nouns feature it".	NP
C.1.2	*a, *ą > ∅ / _ (*-z) #		basic: a > ∅ / _ z #; basic: a > ∅ / _ #; basic: ã > ∅ / _ z #; basic: ã > ∅ / _ #

C.1.7	*-z > ∅	/z/ should be word-final and unstressed.	basic: z > ∅ / @ _ #
C.1.8	*Cj > *CʲCʲ	/z-j/ and /r-j/ do not change. We still use C instead of Cʲ for the replaced sound for two reasons: 1) Our IPA transcriber doesn't make the distinction between C and Cʲ; 2) The CL-type rules do not support palatalization.	CLL: j > [+long] / [-syllabic, !z, !r] _
C.1.9	*C(l/r) > *CC(l/r)	Only *p, *t, *k, and *h are affected. The disyllabic requirement is ignored.	basic: p > pː / _ l; basic: p > pː / _ r; basic: t > tː / _ l; basic: t > tː / _ r; basic: k > kː / _ l; basic: k > kː / _ r; basic: x > xː / _ l; basic: x > xː / _ r
C.1.10	*Ṽ# > *V		basic: [+syllabic, +nasal] > [-nasal] / _ #
C.1.11	*-i, *-u > ∅	The trigger condition "in third and later syllables if preceded by anything other than a single nonsyllabic which was in turn preceded by a short high vowel" is too complicated for our rule templates to represent. Reversion strategy also doesn't help since the reversion would be an epenthesis rule, which we currently do not support.	UR-O
C.1.12	*-ō(r) > *-ā(r)#; *-ô(r) > *-ō(r)#	In other unstressed syllables, /oːː/ merged with /oː/. Since word-final (or before a word-final /r/) /oːː/ is also unstressed, then every /oːː/ becomes /oː/.	basic: oː > aː / @ _ #; basic: oː > aː / @ _ r #; basic: oːː{-} > oː

C.1.15	*C(C)V > *C(C)V̄	It affects monosyllabic words.	MS
C.1.16	*-jj-, *-ww- > *-ij-, *-uw-		UR-E
C.1.17	*/x/ > *[h] / #_	We treat this as irregular/out-of-scope for several reasons: 1) The description seems to be uncertain; 2) The treatment of the grapheme <h> is inconsistent for different IPA transcribers; 3) This doesn't seem to affect any of the following rules.	IRG

C.1.19	*-izd- > *-īd		CLL: z > iː / @ i _ d

D.1.1.1	[+nasal] > ∅	The preceding vowel undergoes compensatory lengthening and nasalization. Since CL-type only supports lengthening, nasalization is ignored.	CLL: [+nasal, -syllabic] > [+long] / [+syllabic] _ [+fricative]
D.1.1.2	*e > *i / _ m		basic: e > i / m
D.1.1.3	*a, *o > [+front]	We treat this as out-of-scope since this seems to be an umbrella rule that has different realizations for the daughter languages.	MISC
D.1.1.4	*-lþ- > *-ld-		basic: θ > ð / @ l _ @
D.1.1.5	*sl > *ls		UR-M
D.1.1.6	*ā, *ē > *ē	We treat this as out-of-scope since this is considered as a morphological innovation that results in syncretism.	NP
D.1.1.7	*h > ∅ / _CC	"This innovation was not exactly regular".	IRG
D.1.1.8	*-z > ∅	It affects monosyllabic words.	MS
D.1.1.9	*VfV, *VbV > *VbV		basic: f > ꞵ / [+syllabic] _ [+syllabic]
D.2.1.1	*a > [+front]	This is similar to D.1.1.3, the details of which depend on the specific language.	MISC
D.2.1.2	*ō > *ā / [-stress]		basic: oː{-} > aː
E.1.0		We introduce rules for merging several short nasal vowels with their oral counterparts for this period, for two reasons: 1) According to Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Norse_language#Vowels], /ã/, /ĩ/, and /ũ/, which occur word-finally, might have merged with their oral counterparts; 2) The Old Norse scripts that our dataset is written in do not distinguish between nasal vowels and oral vowels. Adding these rules empirically increases the coverage of edit distance significantly.
E.1.1	*-ô, *-ō > -ō		basic: oːː > oː / @ _

E.1.4	*ai > ei		basic: ai > ei
E.1.5	ǫ > u; a > e	Both vowels should be unstressed. However, the second change a > e is ignored due to two reasons: 1) Removing it will significantly increase the coverage of edit distance; 2) The original reference given in the thesis (Noreen 1903:107) didn't mention this change.	basic: ɔ{-} > u
E.1.6	*ai > á / _ r/h	This happens before E.1.4.	basic: ai > aː / _ r; basic: ai > aː / _ x

E.1.10	i-umlaut	Triggered by /i/. The exact details are not clear from the description, so I used the information from Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse#Umlaut]. Note that /j/ can also trigger i-umlaut, but VS-type rules do not allowed it, and therefore it is unrepresentable.
E.1.11	V̄ > V / [-stress]	Also includes shortening of diphthongs, ai > i and au > o.	basic: [+long, +syllabic]{-} > [-long]; basic: ai{-} > i; basic: au{-} > o
E.1.12	R-umlaut	The exact details are not clear from the description, so I used the information from Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse#Umlaut].
E.1.13	u-umlaut	Triggered by unstressed /u/ or /o/. The exact details are not clear from the description, so I used the information from Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Norse#Umlaut]. Note that /w/ can also trigger u-umlaut, but VS-type rules do not allow it, and therefore it is unrepresentable.
E.1.14	*e > *ea > ja; *e > *eu > jo	Breaking of *e didn't happen if it follows sonorants or /v/. This was changed to /j-a/ if it was followed /a/ and /j-o/ if it was followed by /u/. Use the reversion strategy.	VS: e > ia / _ a; basic: ia > e / [+sonorant] _; basic: ia > e / v _; VS: e > io / _ u; basic: io > e / [+sonorant] _; basic: io > e / v _; OGF: ia > a; OGF: io > o
E.1.15	*au > ó	/au/ should precede /x/.	basic: au > oː / _ x

E.1.25	*kj, *gj > kkj, ggj		basic: k > kː / _ j; basic: g > gː / _ j
E.1.26	bera	We treat this as out-of-scope since it seems to reverse a change that happened in the development of Proto-Germanic.	MISC
E.1.27	*i > *e	Occurs before /x/ or a nasal, and before ʀ.	basic: i > e / _ x; basic: i > e / _ [+nasal, -syllabic]; basic: i > e / _ r
E.1.28a	á, ǫ > ǫ	Both merged into the orthographic form <á>, even though phonetically it is closer to <ǫ>. Since the IPA transcriber looks only at the orthography to infer the phonetic value, we will merge /aː/ and /ɔ/ into /aː/ instead.

E.1.38	*hnut > hnot	Treated as out-of-scope since it affects root nouns, which suggests it might not be purely phonological.	NP
E.1.39		We add this rule for two reasons: 1) Through empirical experimentation, apocope of /n/ significantly increases the coverage of edit distance; 2) This might correspond to the rule mentioned in Noreen (1923) § 299, #5.	basic: n > ∅ / _ #
G.1.1	*[awʲwʲ] > *[auj]		UR-E

G.1.8	*hs > x	Grapheme <x> is /ks/.	basic: x > k / _ s
G.1.9	*k, *g > [+palatal]	We used /d͡ʒ/ instead of /dd͡ʒ/ for the affricate since it is what the transcriber produces, and it is easier to write down using our template.	basic: k > t͡ʃ / i _; basic: k > t͡ʃ / iː _; basic: k > t͡ʃ / _ [+syllabic, +front]; basic: k > t͡ʃ / _ æa; basic: g > j / [+syllabic, +front] _; basic: g > j / æa _; basic: g > j / _ [+syllabic, +front]; basic: g > j / _ æa; basic: gː > d͡ʒ / [+syllabic, +front] _; basic: gː > d͡ʒ / æa _; basic: gː > d͡ʒ / _ [+syllabic, +front]; basic: gː > d͡ʒ / _ æa

G.1.13	V > ∅ / C_C	According to Ringe and Taylor (2014) 6.7.3, V must be /æ/, /e/, /i/, and /u/ and be unstressed after a stressed vowel. /i/ and /u/ additionally require that the previous syllable be heavy, which we ignore in this study.	basic: æ{-} > ∅ / [+syllabic]{+} [-syllabic] _ [-syllabic]; basic: e{-} > ∅ / [+syllabic]{+} [-syllabic] _ [-syllabic]; basic: i{-} > ∅ / [+syllabic]{+} [-syllabic] _ [-syllabic]; basic: u{-} >  ∅ / [+syllabic]{+} [-syllabic] _ [-syllabic]
G.1.14	*i, *u > ∅ / _#	Word-final and "after heavy syllables and after unstressed syllables preceded by a stressed light syllable". Treated as unrepresentable, since word-final positions require # in the normal sequence, while the syllable requirement needs the vowel sequence.	UR-O
